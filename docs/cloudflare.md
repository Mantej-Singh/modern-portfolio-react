# üåê Professional Domain Migration: From GitHub Pages to Cloudflare

*This is the story of how a simple, hard-to-remember GitHub Pages URL evolved into a polished, professional web presence‚Äîpowered by a strategic investment in Cloudflare‚Äôs domain and CDN services.*

---

What started as a student project hosted at a lengthy address‚Äî`mantej-singh.github.io/modern-portfolio-react/`‚Äîwas always more than just a portfolio. It was a living record of growth, ambition, and technical curiosity. But as my skills matured and my aspirations grew, so did the need for a digital identity that reflected professionalism and future-readiness.

This migration wasn‚Äôt just about shortening a URL. It was about transforming perception: from a hobbyist‚Äôs corner of the web to a developer‚Äôs personal brand, ready for recruiters, clients, and collaborators worldwide. The move to `mantejsingh.dev`‚Äîa clean, memorable, and developer-focused domain‚Äîsignaled a new chapter. 

Choosing Cloudflare as the foundation was a deliberate, future-focused decision. Beyond just a domain registrar, Cloudflare brought enterprise-grade performance, security, and analytics‚Äîtools that not only improved my site, but also deepened my understanding of modern web infrastructure.

This document details every step of that journey: the research, the technical hurdles, the strategic choices, and the lessons learned. It‚Äôs a roadmap for anyone ready to invest in their own professional presence, and a testament to the value of thinking beyond the code‚Äîtoward the infrastructure and strategy that power great

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Technical Implementation**

### **Phase 1: Repository Configuration** 

#### **A. CNAME File Creation**
```bash
# File: /public/CNAME
mantejsingh.dev
```
- **Purpose**: Tells GitHub Pages which domain to serve this repository for
- **Location**: Must be in `/public/` folder (not `/src/`)
- **Content**: Single line with custom domain

#### **B. Vite Configuration Update**
```typescript
// File: vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig(() => {
  return {
    plugins: [react()],
    resolve: {
      alias: {
        "@": path.resolve(__dirname, "./src"),
      },
    },
    // Changed from subdirectory to root path for custom domain
    base: '/', // Previously: '/modern-portfolio-react/'
    build: {
      outDir: 'dist',
      assetsDir: 'assets',
    }
  }
});
```

### **Phase 2: Cloudflare DNS Configuration**

#### **DNS Records Setup**
```
Record 1 - Root Domain:
  Type: CNAME
  Name: @ (mantejsingh.dev)
  Target: mantej-singh.github.io
  Proxy: ‚úÖ Proxied (Orange cloud ON)
  TTL: Auto

Record 2 - WWW Subdomain:
  Type: CNAME
  Name: www
  Target: mantejsingh.dev
  Proxy: ‚úÖ Proxied (Orange cloud ON)
  TTL: Auto
```

#### **Critical Implementation Note**
**DNS Target Logic**: The target `mantej-singh.github.io` (WITHOUT `/modern-portfolio-react/` path) works because:
1. DNS can only point to domains, not paths
2. GitHub Pages uses the CNAME file to determine which repository to serve
3. The magic happens at GitHub's routing layer, not DNS layer

### **Phase 3: GitHub Pages Integration**

#### **Custom Domain Configuration**
```
Repository: modern-portfolio-react
Settings ‚Üí Pages:
  Source: GitHub Actions (maintains existing CI/CD)
  Custom domain: mantejsingh.dev
  Enforce HTTPS: ‚úÖ Enabled
  
Result: ‚úÖ DNS check successful
```

#### **GitHub Actions Workflow** (No changes required)
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml continues to work seamlessly
name: Deploy React Portfolio to GitHub Pages
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  
# Build and deploy process unchanged
# GitHub automatically serves to custom domain
```
